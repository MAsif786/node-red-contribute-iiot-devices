# Intro
My idea around a software that I developed from scratch. Now I want to add in node-red that structre of reading iiot devices with already defined config files. Now developing and learning about node-red custom node development. 
# node-red-contribute-iiot-devices
Node-red contribute a node provide industrial devices data reading configs. A person just have to add a node and select device from a list and data reading started and provides metadata required. E.g: value (label,unit etc) .
